1. Check stack canary functions, how are these different from unchecked functions
  fix_print is legitimate, contains large char buffer, fstack-protector-strong triggers when cordic() called with address taken of local var in sin, cos, tan
2. Refactor double.c?
  Does this actually help?
  double *
3. Make cycle counts work
  Should be fine, requires very simple kernel module
  Could perf() work better?
4. Compare performance with/without fmov + cmge vs cmp (get raspberry pi / packet)
  performance is comparable, no simd is slightly faster
  packet doesn't actually have arm machines available
5. Double check every instance of bad instructions (checklist)
  done

binary search through fix_pow to find timing variation
refactor from/to double to double *
